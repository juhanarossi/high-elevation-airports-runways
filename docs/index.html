			<p>Closer you get to the sky, getting aloft becomes trickier. This is because at higher altitudes thinner
				air reduces an aircraft’s capability to take off in two ways.
				First, thinner air provides less for an aircraft. Hence, an aircraft to take off needs to greater speed
				to become safely airborne. Second, at higher altitudes there is less oxygen compared to lower altitudes.
				This degrades a jetliner’s engine performance because the engines have less oxygen to burn.
				<br>

				These two factors mean that an aircraft taking off needs a longer takeoff run to attain a greater
				takeoff speed at a high elevation airport than at a low elevation airport.

			<p>Airbus A350 is a modern twin-engine widebody jetliner. Assuming that it is taking off in a full load from
				Helsinki airport in Finland to a typical commercial flight to Denver airport in Colorado, it needs a
				6,043-feet long takeoff run to achieve takeoff speed of 146 knots for a safe takeoff.
				For a hypothetical return trip from Denver to Helsinki, the aircraft would require a 9,954-feet long
				takeoff run for a takeoff speed of 162 knots. Takeoff speed refers to the VR or rotation speed which is
				the speed at which the pilot starts to lift the aircraft off the ground to initiate flight.
				<br>

				The differences in the takeoff rolls and speeds are  explained  the airports’ respective elevations relative to the mean sea level.
				Helsinki is a coastal city, and Helsinki airport lies 179 feet above sea level. Denver airport is
				situated on a high plain on the fringe of the Rocky Mountains at an elevation of 5,430 feet.
				<br>

				Elevation's effect on aircrafts’ takeoff performance manifests itself in the
				average length of runways at airports at different elevations. Airports at higher elevations have longer
				runways on average than airports at lower elevations.

			<p>There is no official definition for a high elevation airport. Often, a high elevation airport is defined
				as an airport that lies at an elevation 8,000 feet or greater. Based on information in the <a
					href="https://ourairports.com/">ourairports.com</a> database, there are 40 medium-size or large
				civilian airports in the world that meet
				this criterion.
				For a more nuanced breakdown of airports in accordance to their elevation, in this article airports with
				an elevation of 8,000 feet or greater have been defined as ultra-high elevation airports. They are
				mainly located in the Andes in South America and in China.

				High elevation airports are defined in this article as airports with an elevation between 5,000 and
				8,000 feet. Both ultra-high and high elevation are relatively few. They constitute only 4% of
				medium-size and large airports in the ourairports.com database. In all, there are 4,769 medium-size or
				large airports in the database
				The highest elevation airport in the world is now <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daocheng_Yading_Airport">Daocheng Yading airport</a> in China.
				It lies at an
				elevation of 14,472 feet, higher than the summit of <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney">Mount Whitney</a>, the tallest mountain in the
				contiguous United States.
