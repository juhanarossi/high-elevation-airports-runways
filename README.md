# Charting the Relationship between Airport Elevation and Runway Length
## Overview
The objective of this project was to see if there is a correlation in the elevation of an airport and the length of his runway or runways and the visualize my findings in simple but effective charts and then incorporate those charts in a webpage with a simple but effecttive visual design that is in harmony with the charts.
## Technical Description
After some web searches, I downloaded the ourairports.com data stored in GitHub repository. I then the analyzed and processed the data with Python and Pandas. Notebooks for this work are in the `notebooks` folder.
## Data
The csv files containing both raw and refined data are in the `data` folder. The same folder also contains the Excel file that has the data I used to create the two charts used in the article. **Important note on the data: the raw data is incomplete and erroneous.** It has been compiled by volunteers, not by any single organization or agency. I checked by hand all the data about the airports featured in the scatter plot. That data should be accurate. The information comparing the length of an A350 takeoff rolls in Denver and Helsinki is accurate, too. However, the information comparing the average lengths of longest runways at airports relative to their elevation should be considered approximate only. 
## Visualization
 I used Datawrapper to create the charts. Links to the charts are [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hoMvN/4/), [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iqOs1/3/) and [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qk42g/3/).
 ## Webpage
The code and images for the webpage are in the `docs` folder. The webpage is [here](https://juhanarossi.github.io/high_elevation_airports-runways/). I worked with `css` and created a style sheet through trial and error.
## Lessons Learned
This project was about learning to create effective charts that illustrate data effective with nothing redundant and with as few design flaws as possible. I made progress in this area. My next step is to learn to use `ggplot` and `illustrator` to make the charts more effective.
